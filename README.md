# SoulSwap Exchange Assets Info

![Check](https://github.com/trustwallet/assets/workflows/Check/badge.svg)

## Overview
Trust Wallet token repository is a comprehensive, up-to-date collection of information about several thousands (!) of crypto tokens.

[Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com) uses token logos from this source, alongside a number of other projects.

The repository contains token info from several blockchains, info on dApps, staking validators, etc.
For every token a logo and optional additional information is available (such data is not available on-chain).

Such a large collection can be maintained only through a community effort, so _contributions are welcome_,
primarily from token projects.

Please note that __new tokens are not accepted__,
the projects have to be sound, with information available, and __non-minimal circulation__
(for limit details see https://community.trustwallet.com/t/how-to-submit-a-token-logo/3863).

## How to add token

Details of the repository structure and contribution guidelines are listed on the
[Developers site](https://developer.trustwallet.com/add_new_asset).
Here is a quick starter summary for the most common use case.

**Adding an ERC20 token checklist**:
- [ ] Make sure your smartcontract has more than 2,500 address holders, otherwise you will be rejected
- [ ] Fork the Github repository
- [ ] Create folder with name of token smartcontact address in [_checksum format_](https://developer.trustwallet.com/add_new_asset#checksum_format) `blockchains/ethereum/assets/<token_smartcontract_address>/`.
- [ ] Tell your designer that token image must be in PNG format, recommended size 256x256px, max. 512x512px, with max file size of 100kB, for further details read [image rules](https://developer.trustwallet.com/add_new_asset#image-requirements).
- [ ] Upload your logo with file named `logo.png` to previously created folder with smartcontract address, and if you done all correctly your path should look like this. `blockchains/ethereum/assets/0x1234567461d3f8Db7496581774Bd869C83D51c93/logo.png`
- [ ] Create a pull request to the main repo
